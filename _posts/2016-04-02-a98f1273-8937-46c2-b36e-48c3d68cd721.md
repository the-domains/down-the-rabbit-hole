Dualities of Awe

****

Sunrises, a new day, a new way, seize it, for it is yours

Open your mind and open your heart, this a great place to start

If you do these things, where you once saw walls you will see doors               

The I AM that, the awe in all, sha'll always be, never apart

****

I AM playing infinitely, both in perspectives and in space

Sharing my eternal ever expansive light to all in awe

I AM in all but we begin to remember through the human race

The dance of dualities the spin, the balance the see-saw

****

There can be no light without dark, life without death, this is true

We must learn to embrace both sides to become happy and whole

To see the world in wonder a youthful and profound view

Expand your circle, go beyond, metamorphosis is the goal

****

A butterfly, transformation, to see yourself beyond form

Stay grounded but know that you transcend all things here in this realm

Take a chance and allow yourself do something out of the norm

Captain of your soul master of none stand tall at the sublime helm

****

Bitter sweet, the storm approaches, be brave, be bold, hold tight

Stinging rain, cold breeze, with wheel in hand, the waves come crashing down

Lost lives, friends come and go, stay the course into the star filled night

It happens when the storm ends, magnificent, no need to frown

****

You emerge, stronger than ever before, a captain of captains

You've transcended all fears and form, you've finally come home free from debt

Shining infinitely, you illuminated soul, free from the chains 

A life that was seized, a work of art, a fair bet, you smile watching the sunset.

****
